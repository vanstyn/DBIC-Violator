=head1 NAME

DBIC::Violator - Violate DBIC's most private moments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use DBIC::Violator
   application_name => "Some app name V1.234",
   username_from_res_header => 'X-RapidApp-Authenticated';
 
 ...
 
 use DBIC::Violator::Plack::Middleware;
 use Plack::Builder;

 builder {
   enable '+DBIC::Violator::Plack::Middleware';
   $psgi_app
 };
 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EXPERIMENTAL - not ready for production use

This is module "violates" L<DBIx::Class> by tracking all queries and logging them to an SQLite 
database. It does not do this in a "nice" or correct way, hence the tongue-in-cheek name. 
It does not use the already provided debugobj API; instead it wraps method modifiers on DBIC 
global storage classes in order to intercept all DBIC-originated queries process-wide.

The Plack middleware L<DBIC::Violator::Plack::Middleware> is also provided which can be used
in Plack apps to track and link all DBIC queries and associate them with a parent HTTP 
request.

This module exists for some specific uses and may not ever be supported and so you probably
shouldn't use it. Full documentation maybe TBD.
